# Actions

NOTE: Do not add new actions to this repo. Create a separate repo per
action instead. Eventually, the existing workflows will also be factored
out and this repo deprecated/archived/removed.

This repo contains [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
workflows/actions shared across our organization. This repo is designed
only for internal use but must be public due to current limitations on [reusable
workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#access-to-reusable-workflows).
